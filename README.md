  <h3>Desc</h3>
  <p>A theme that is based off Manas140's "Paradise" theme. <br>
  I decayed the colors even more and made it 16 colors.</p>

  <h3>Note</h3>
  <p>this is a work in progress so for now I only made an Xresources file.
  soon I will make an alacritty colorscheme,<br>
  and then a vim colorscheme (when I learn how lmao).</p>
